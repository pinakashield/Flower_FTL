Here's a full `README.md` for your **Federated Transfer Learning Intrusion Detection System** built using Flower, PyTorch, and CICIDS 2017:

# 🛡️ Federated Transfer Learning for Intrusion Detection

This repository implements a robust, modular **Intrusion Detection and Mitigation System** using **Federated Transfer Learning (FTL)** with the [Flower](https://flower.dev/) framework. It supports detection of **DDoS**, **MITM**, and other network anomalies in a privacy-preserving federated setup.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Federated Learning (FL)** with PyTorch + Flower
- 🧠 **Transfer Learning (TL)** to adapt to new clients
- 🛡️ **Attack Simulation & Detection** (DDoS, MITM)
- 🔁 **Fine-Tuning Strategy** with drift detection
- 📊 **Client-level logs** (accuracy, behavior, FTL usage)
- 🧩 **Dynamic Client Participation**
- ⚡ **Real-time dashboard** (Streamlit – coming soon!)
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook for Analysis** (included)

---

## 🧠 Architecture

### Components:
- `client.py`: Simulates clients (Normal, DDoS, MITM) and supports transfer learning.
- `server.py`: Hosts the federated server, handles aggregation, logs behaviors, and fine-tunes models.
- `model.py`: Neural network with separable base and head for transfer learning.
- `utils.py`: Data loaders and preprocessing for the CICIDS 2017 dataset.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/federated-ftl-ids.git
cd federated-ftl-ids
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare dataset
Place `CICIDS_2017.csv` under the `dataset/` folder.

---

## 🧪 Running the System

### 🖥️ Start the Server
```bash
python server.py
```

### 👥 Launch Clients (Any number!)
Each client simulates a different behavior.

#### Client 0: DDoS attacker
```bash
python client.py 0
```

#### Client 1: MITM attacker
```bash
python client.py 1
```

#### Client 2+: Normal / Transfer Learning Client
```bash
IS_NEW_CLIENT=true python client.py 2
IS_NEW_CLIENT=true python client.py 3
```

You can run as many as you want — the server will dynamically handle them!

---

## ⚙️ Federated Transfer Learning (FTL)

- New clients set `IS_NEW_CLIENT=true`
- They only train the **classifier head**, freezing the feature extractor.
- Server logs each client's FTL use and behavior.

---

## 📊 Visualization & Analysis

### Drift / FTL Timeline:
```bash
python client_accuracy_drift.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook Federated_Analysis.ipynb
```

### Streamlit Dashboard (Live Monitoring):
```bash
streamlit run dashboards/streamlit_dashboard.py
```

## 📁 Logs & Output

- **`suspicious_clients_log.csv`** – attack detection logs
- **`ftl_client_log.csv`** – client transfer learning usage
- **`ftl_round_metrics.csv`** – global accuracy/loss per round
- **`ftl_training_metrics.png`** – line chart of training metrics

---

## 🛡️ Attack Simulation

- **DDoS Client** sends high-magnitude random gradients.
- **MITM Client** sends reversed/poisoned gradients.
- Server detects and **quarantines** malicious clients.

---

## 💡 Future Ideas

- [ ] Federated adversarial training
- [ ] Personalization through continual learning
- [ ] Multi-task FL (e.g., separate models for MITM vs DDoS)
